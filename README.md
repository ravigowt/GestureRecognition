# GestureRecognition

Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote

In this group project, you are going to build a 3D Conv model that will be able to predict the 5 gestures correctly. Please import the following libraries to get started.

Thumbs up: Increase the volume,
